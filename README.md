# My resume

For any tailoring to specific companies/postings, separate branches should be made and pushed to.

# Compilation
First you need to export some environment variables:
- `PHONE_NUMBER`
- `EMAIL`
- `LINKEDIN`

Then you need to run:
```sh
make
```
which will create `resume.pdf` and `unredacted.pdf`.
